# F-Spotify
Code to download music from youtube on my phone so I don't have to use spotify.

To run on your iphone you need a-shell. I used the shortcuts app to run multiple commands at once through a widget. But basically the setup is in whatever folder you want (probably needs to be in the a-shell folder), have at least 3 folders. Called "Code", "Songs", and "Playlists". Then pop these files in the Code folder with a venv if you want and a text file called tmp.txt to get the link to the playlist and the playlist name if you are adding to the playlist.
