# F-Spotify
Code to download music from youtube on my phone so I don't have to use spotify.

To run on your iphone you need a-shell. I used the shortcuts app to run multiple commands at once through a widget. But basically the setup is in whatever folder you want (probably needs to be in the a-shell folder), have at least 3 folders. Called "Code", "Songs", and "Playlists". Then pop these files in the Code folder with a venv if you want and a text file called tmp.txt to get the link to the playlist and the playlist name if you are adding to the playlist. But you can just run init.py and it will do it for you.

You can fiddle with the shortcuts to make them work as in change the file paths. Also some of the shortcuts use Toolbox Pro but the free stuff. It is a free app.

Was made in python version: 3.11 pytube version: 15.0.0.
